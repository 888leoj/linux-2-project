This is my groups (or part of my groups) backup script program.
core backup part (backup files somewhere).
some sort of scheduler for the backups.
multi point restores and multi site/online part.
some sort of check if the files havent been updated.
everyone should try to make some basic back up script to easily understand it -- (theres alot of good examples and videos online).
encryption (extra?)
